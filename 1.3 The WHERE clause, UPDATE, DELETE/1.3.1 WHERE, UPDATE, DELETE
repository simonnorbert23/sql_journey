# when we want to retrieve all of the columns, use *:
SELECT * FROM cats;

# when we want to retrieve a specific column, specify it instead of the *:
SELECT name FROM cats;

# when we want to retrieve specific columns, list them and separate them with a comma:
SELECT name, breed FROM cats;

# we can use the WHERE clause to narrow down the selection. We can filter for numeric value and 
#strings (it's not case sensitive - unless enforced - but the order of characters needs to match the one in the table):
SELECT name, age FROM cats WHERE age > 4;
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE breed = 'Tabby';

# if we want to have a column renamed in teh current output, we can use the AS keyword to assign an alias:
SELECT cat_id AS id, name FROM cats;
SELECT name AS kittyName FROM cats;

# when we want to change a value, we use UPDATE with SET to specify the new value:
UPDATE employees SET last_name = 'Roosterbeard';

#we can update a filtered set of data using the WHERE clause:
UPDATE cats SET age = 14 WHERE name = 'Misty';

# we can use DELETE with the WHERE clause to delete a targeted portion of a table:
DELETE FROM cats WHERE name = 'Egg';

# without the WHERE clause we would delete all the data from teh table. The table would be still there, but it would be empty:
DELETE FROM cats;
