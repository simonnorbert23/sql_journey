## we can reverse a string with REVERSE
SELECT REVERSE('chicken nuggets');
SELECT REVERSE(author_fname) FROM books;
SELECT CONCAT(author_fname, REVERSE(author_fname)) FROM books;

## to find out the number of characters of the string we can use CHAR_LENGTH
## not to be confused with LENGTH, which restore the string length in bytes
SELECT CHAR_LENGTH(title) AS length, title FROM books;

## to change teh casing of the string we can use UPPER and LOWER
## UCASE and LCASE are their synonims
SELECT UPPER('hello');
SELECT LOWER('HELLO');
SELECT UPPER(title) FROM books;
SELECT CONCAT('I LOVE ', UPPER(title), '!!!') FROM books;

## other interesting string functions are:
##	INSERT add substring to existing strings. 0 marks the characters to be replaced
SELECT INSERT('Hello Bobby', 6, 0, ' There');
SELECT INSERT('Hello Bobby', 6, 6, ' There');

##	LEFT and RIGHT are functions that are retrieving the lefternmost and rightmost character
SELECT LEFT(title, 5) FROM books;
SELECT RIGHT(author_lname, 3) FROM books;

##	we can repeat a string
SELECT REPEAT('ha', 5);

##	we can trim off leading and trailing spaces
SELECT TRIM('   boston   ');
SELECT 
    TRIM(LEADING '.' FROM '...san antonio...'),
    TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM '...san antonio...');
