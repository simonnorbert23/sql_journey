## counting items - star means that rows will be counted
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM books;

## we can count all the items in a column - it's not counting unique values and it counts NULL value
SELECT COUNT(author_fname) FROM books;

## we can look for unique values
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT author_fname) FROM books;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT released_year) FROM books;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT author_lname) FROM books;

## how many title contain the word 'the'
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM books WHERE title LIKE '%the%';

## GROUP BY aggregates or summarizes rows into single rows
SELECT author_lname FROM books;
SELECT author_lname FROM books GROUP BY author_lname;

## count how many each author has written
SELECT author_lname, COUNT(*) FROM books GROUP BY author_lname;
SELECT author_lname, COUNT(*) AS books_written FROM books GROUP BY author_lname ORDER BY books_written DESC;

## let's find out how many books have been released each year
SELECT released_year, COUNT(*) AS book_count FROM books GROUP BY released_year ORDER BY book_count DESC;

## the below won't work cause it can't select unique values when it's focused on groups
SELECT * FROM books GROUP BY author_lname; 

## but we can focus on the column based on which the grouping is done (even of it doesn't make much sense in this form)
SELECT author_lname FROM books GROUP BY author_lname;

## looking for minimum and maximum values
SELECT MIN(released_year) FROM books;
SELECT MAX(pages) FROM books;
SELECT MIN(author_lname), MAX(author_lname) FROM books;
