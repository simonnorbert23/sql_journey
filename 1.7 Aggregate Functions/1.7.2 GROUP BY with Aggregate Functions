## MIN/MAX with GROUP BY
## find the year each author published their first book
SELECT author_lname, MIN(released_year) FROM books GROUP BY author_lname;

## find teh latest book they wrote
SELECT author_lname, MAX(released_year) FROM books GROUP BY author_lname;

## find their earliest and latest year of book release
