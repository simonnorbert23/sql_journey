-- What's a good use case for char?

-- when we are sure that the input won't exceed a certain length (weekdays, months)

-- Fill in the blanks with the apprpriate data types
-- price is always < 1,000,000

CREATE TABLE inventory (
item_name VARCHAR(50),
price DECIMAL(8, 2),
quantity INT);

-- What's the difference between DATETIME and TIMESTAMP?

-- DATETIME takes a specified value while TIMESTAMP will equate to current date and time, synonim of NOW()
-- TIMESTAMP is more memory-efficient but will return a much narrower range

-- Write a statement to print out the current time

SELECT CURTIME();

-- Write a statement to print out the current date (but not time)

SELECT CURDATE();

-- print out the current day of the week as a number

SELECT DAYOFWEEK(CURDATE());
SELECT DAYNAME(CURDATE());

-- print out the current day and time using this format: mm/dd/yyyy

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%m/%d/%Y');

-- print out the current day and time using this format: January 2nd at 3:15, April 1st at 10:18

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%M %D at %H:%i');

-- Create a tweets table that stores the tweet content, a username, time it was created

CREATE TABLE tweets_table (
tweet_content VARCHAR(140),
username VARCHAR(30),
created_at TIMESTAMP default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

INSERT INTO tweets_table (tweet_content, username)
VALUES ('YOLOOOOO', 'tom_hanks90');

SELECT * FROM tweets_table;
