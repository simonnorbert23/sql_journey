-- CAST helps convert one datatype to another

SELECT CAST('9:00:00' AS TIME);

SELECT * FROM people WHERE birthtime BETWEEN '10:00:00' AND '16:00:00';

SELECT * FROM people WHERE birthtime 
BETWEEN CAST('10:00:00' AS TIME) AND 
CAST('16:00:00' AS TIME);

SELECT * FROM people 
WHERE HOUR(birthtime) BETWEEN 10 AND 16;

-- IN operator: replaces a chain of OR-s

SELECT title, author_lname FROM books
WHERE author_lname = 'Carver'
OR author_lname = 'Lahiri'
OR author_lname = 'Smith';

SELECT title, author_lname FROM books
WHERE author_lname IN ('Carver', 'Lahiri', 'Smith');

-- NOT IN is reverse of IN

SELECT title, author_lname FROM books
WHERE author_lname NOT IN ('Carver', 'Smith', 'Lahiri');

-- exclude books publishe din even years using modulo (remainder)

SELECT title, released_year FROM books
WHERE released_year >= 2000 
AND released_year % 2 != 0;

-- CASE statements 

SELECT title, released_year, 
  CASE

    WHEN stock_quantity BETWEEN 101 AND 140 THEN '****'
    ELSE '*****'

-- to make the above a little less clunky

SELECT title, stock_quantity,

    WHEN stock_quantity <= 100 THEN '***'
