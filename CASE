Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. 
If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

SELECT flower1, flower2, (CASE 
  WHEN (flower1 % 2 = 0 AND  flower2 % 2 = 1) OR
  (flower1 % 2 = 1 AND flower2 % 2 = 0)
  THEN true
  ELSE false
  END) AS res
FROM love;
