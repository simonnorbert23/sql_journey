Given a demographics table in the following format:

** demographics table schema **

id
name
birthday
race
you need to return the same table where all text fields (name & race) are changed to the bit length of the string.

SELECT id, 
  CAST (BIT_LENGTH(name) AS INT) AS name, 
  birthday, 
  CAST (BIT_LENGTH(race) AS INT) AS race
FROM demographics;
