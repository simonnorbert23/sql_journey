Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first n multiples of x.

Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

Return the results as an array or list ( depending on language ).

Examples
countBy(1,10)  should return  {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
countBy(2,5)  should return {2,4,6,8,10}

-- # write your SQL statement here: 
-- you are given a table 'counter' with columns 'x' (int) and 'n' (int)
-- return a query with columns 'x', 'n' and your result in a column named 'res' (array)
-- sort results by column 'x' ascending, then by 'n' ascending
-- note that each pair of 'x' and 'n' in 'counter' is unique 

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION countby(firstp1 INT, p2 INT)
  RETURNS INT[] AS $$
  DECLARE
    step INT := 0;
    p1 INT := 0;
    list INT [] := ARRAY[]::INT[];
    BEGIN
      WHILE step != p2 LOOP
        p1 := firstp1 + p1;
        list := ARRAY_APPEND(list, p1);
        step := step + 1;
      END LOOP;
  RETURN list;
    END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
