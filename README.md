This is a journal of how I'm learning SQL

## Some theory

A database is... 
  * ...a collection of data
  * ...a method for accessing and manipulating data
  * ...a structured set of computerized data with an accessible interface
  
An RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) is an interface for the database and lets us (or our application) access the database.

## MySQL vs. SQL

* SQL is the language we use to communicate with our databases. Here's a humanized version of an SQL query: "Find the customers called Jim"
* Working with MySQL is essentially writing SQL code.
* SQL is a standard that RDBMS-s implemennt. 
* There are slight differences in how the RDBMS-s implement the language.
* Once you know SQL it's quite easy to switch between RDBMS-s.
* RDBMS-s are unique in what features they offer (security, speed, etc.), not in their language/syntax.
